%h3 Q: What is the purpose of the To Do page?
%p A: The To Do page helps us decide what to work on at a given moment by automatically sorting all unfinished tasks and orders by approximate priority.  This reduces the need for a person to make these decisions and helps us use our time more wisely.  To Do prioritizes tasks based on 3 principles: tasks that are due sooner have priority, tasks that are older have priority, and tasks that are very time consuming have priority.  Tasks are also broadly grouped as one of 3 levels of priority: high (red circle), medium (orange circle), low (green circle) or frozen/no-priority (blue circle).  High priority tasks should ALL be assigned and in-progress before moving on to the medium priority tasks.  Medium priority tasks should ALL be assigned and in-progress before moving on to the low priority tasks.  The priority circles are also a visual indicator of how urgent the current workload is and can help answer questions such as, 'Can I take a vacation day tomorrow?'.
